### Technical Background

During my senior year of high school, I took AP Computer Science A and AP Computer Science Principles. With these two courses, I gathered a basic understanding of both Java and JavaScript. Then during my first year here at Grand Valley, I took CIS 162 and CIS 163 which were heavily centered on Java. Lastly, over the summer, I took both MTH 225 and CIS 241. In MTH 225, I completed one project in Python so I gained a little bit of knowledge in the structure of Python and then in CIS 241, I learned and built a strong foundation of knowledge of the programming language, C. We briefly discussed Linux, using the terminal, and Bash Scripting as well.
